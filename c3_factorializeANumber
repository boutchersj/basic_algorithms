function factorialize(num) {
  if (num === 0) {
    return 1
  }
  else {
  let i = num-1;
  while (i > 1) {
    num*= i;
    i--;
  }
  return num;
}
}
factorialize(5);

//I used a shortuct by taking 'num=0' out of the algorithm with a simple 'if' statement
//After that, I just looped through all the numbers south of the given number until they hit 1, multiplying 'num' by all of them

Advanced Solution:

function factorialize(num) {
  let factorialized = 1
  for (let i = num; i > 0; i--){
    factorialized *= i
  }
  return num === 1 ? 1 : factorialized
}

//Reduced lines of code by using the ternary operator to return the appropriate number depending on the parameter's initial value
