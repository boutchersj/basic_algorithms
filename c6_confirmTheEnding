//My first step was to figure out how I was going to compare the target string to the ending of the 'str' string
//I realized that if I spelled both strings backwards, they would both look identical at the beginning if there was a match
/* An example to illustrate this is below:
str = 'sandwich';
target = 'wich';
REVERSED
'hciwdnas'
'hciw'
AS ARRAYS
['h','c','i','w','d','n','a','s']
['h','c','i','w']
*/
//I realized an easy way to check for a match was to convert the strings to arrays and reverse them
//After that, it was just a matter of a simple for loop to check the 'str' array from the beginning up to the target string's length
