//This function's purpose is to transfer the contents in order from 'arr1' to 'arr2' at specified index 'n'
//This function only works if you save a COPY of 'arr2' to a variable
//Saving the original 'arr2' ends up modifying 'arr2' and the challenge says modifying either array is not allowed
//Modifying the COPY is allowed

/*My step-by-step is as follows:
1) Save a copy of 'arr2' to the variable 'resultArr'
2) Iterate through 'arr1', sending the items 1 by 1 over to 'resultArr' at index 'n'
a) Notice that you must add 1 to index 'n' after each iteration to keep the values in order
b) Keeping the index at 'n' for every iteration results in the values transferring in reverse order
c) The reason for this is illustrated below:

[value0, value1, value2] //Before iterations, 'n' will remain '1'

[value0, newValue0, value1, value2] //After first iteration

[value0, newValue1, newValue0, value1, value2] //After 2nd iteration...the values were both inserted at index '1'

3) Return the variable 'resultArr'
