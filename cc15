//'arr' has 2 strings
//The function's purpose is to check if the 2nd string's letters are in the 1st string, too, even if they're out of order or a different case

//First I convert the strings to lowercase and split them into arrays of letters
//This gets rid of the 'different case' issue and lets me check for individual letters
//Then I use a for loop with '.indexOf()' to check the 1st letter array for the existence of each of the 2nd string array's letters
//If there are any letters that don't appear, I return false right away
//As a catch-all for any 'string 2's that pass that test, I return true after the loop ends
