//First I did my input validation to make sure the 'num' wasn't zero or fewer repetitions
//Then I created an empty string
//That empty string was to be added a copy of 'str' until the counter, specified by 'num', reached 0
//It's a lot like the photocopier function we made in a previous section of the certification using the spread operator
