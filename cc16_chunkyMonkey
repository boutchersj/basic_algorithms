//This function's purpose is to chunk the array into smaller arrays the size of 'size' and fit them into a larger array of arrays
//The first step to creating this multi-dimensional array is creating an array variable to store the smaller arrays in
//The next step is to create a for loop to loop through the array 'arr'
//The loop counter increases by 'size' each iteration 
//The '.slice()' method returns small arrays with the values between 'i' and 'i+size' in 'arr'
//This makes sure the slice of the array is 'size' elements big, and in order
//The small array gets pushed to the 'result' array
//The 'result' array is returned!
